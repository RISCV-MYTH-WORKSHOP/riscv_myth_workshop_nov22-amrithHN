# RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop

For students of "Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours" Workshop, offered by for VLSI System Design (VSD) and Redwood EDA, find here accompanying live info and links.

Refer to README at [stevehoover/RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop](https://github.com/stevehoover/RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop) for lab instructions.

Add your codes in the [calculator_solutions.tlv](calculator_solutions.tlv) and [risc-v_solutions.tlv](risc-v_solutions.tlv) files and **keep committing** to your repository after every lab.
